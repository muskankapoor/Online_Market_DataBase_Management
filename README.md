 Online Market - web application Problem: How can we gain more profit from the online market? I am collecting data for this online market created by me and trying to use this data to create more profit. Buyers ware be able to buy things by adding items in their shopping cart. Once they pay their items the system will be able to deliver items and decrease the number of items in the market. Sellers will be able to add more items and the product details and the system will autumnally update the information. Different items will have different prices and a specially generated code (or barcode) will help differentiate all these items. The data that I am collecting here is in regards to the number of items that will be sold will help us differentiate which items are popular and less popular. This will help us eradicate items that are not popular and focus on the sellers that are providing more profit. Cloud platform: AWS and IBM Cloud Databases:  Data I collected Name of the item Unique barcode # brought # sold Company name Taxable  This repo is showing the user side and server-side information.
